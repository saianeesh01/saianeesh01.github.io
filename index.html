        <h2>üéì About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student at Virginia Commonwealth University, graduating in December 2024, with a passion for all things AI and machine learning. I‚Äôm constantly driven to explore emerging technologies and love building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Outside of tech, you‚Äôll probably find me lifting, hooping with friends, designing graphics, or immersed in a good video game ‚Äî Pok√©mon and The Last of Us are my go-to titles (shoutout to Arcanine üî•). My goal is to grow into a dynamic AI/ML engineer, blending logic and creativity to shape the future of technology.
